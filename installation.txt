1 Ensure you have Docker installed

  eg: https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-docker/

2 Ensure you have git installed

  (apt install git)

4 Make sure you're in your home directory, eg cd ~

5 git clone https://github.com/robtweed/mg-showcase

  You'll now have a directory: ~/mg-showcase

6 cd to that directory, eg cd mg-showcase

7 Build the Docker Container that we'll be using:

  docker build -t mg-showcase -f dockerfiles/yottadb/Dockerfile --progress plain .

  It may take a while - let it run to completion

8 Return to your home directory:

    cd ..

9 git clone https://github.com/robtweed/agility

  You'll now have a directory named agility, eg: ~/agility

10  Edit the file *config.json* that you'll see in the *~/agility* directory
and add your SolisCloud credentials to the empty locations.  

  Also make sure your Octopus zone is correct - change it as appropriate.

  Save your edited version of *config.json*.

11 Run the initialisation script:

  cd ~/agility
  source init.sh

12 Start the Docker container and map the agility directory into it.  Use the following command:

docker run -it --name agility --rm -p 8080:8080 -e TZ=Europe/London -v ~/agility/src:/opt/mgateway/mapped mg-showcase

This ensures that:

- the time zone is correctly maintained within the container
- port 8080 is available for Agility's web interface
- the container is named *agility*, eg when you run to see the running container:

  - docker ps

The Agility environment is now set up and ready for use.  You'll normally leave the container running
constantly on your computer: it shouldn't need to be stopped, but if it does stop for any reason, just
restart it with the same *docker run* command above.

12 Start Agility:

  cd ~/agility (if you're not already in this directory)
  ./agility_start

13 You can monitor Agility's activity log at any time:

  cd ~/agility (if you're not already in this directory)
  ./agility_log
